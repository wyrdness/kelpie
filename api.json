      "full": "The kelpie is a malevolent water spirit from Scottish folklore that typically manifests as a beautiful black horse near rivers and lochs. The creature lures unsuspecting humans, particularly children, to mount it, at which point the rider becomes stuck to the kelpie's adhesive skin and is dragged underwater to drown and be devoured. Kelpies can also appear in human form, usually as handsome young men or beautiful women, but always betray their nature through cold, wet skin and water weeds entangled in their hair. In Scottish folklore, kelpies served as cautionary tales warning children about the dangers of water. Capture is possible by bridling the kelpie, which removes its power and makes it an obedient servant. Weaknesses include silver, rowan wood, and speaking its true name. The kelpie represents the deceptive beauty and deadly danger of water, particularly Scotland's deep lochs and fast-flowing rivers."
